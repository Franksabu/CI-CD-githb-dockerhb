# CI-CD-githb-dockerhb
# CI/CD with GitHub, Docker Hub, and GitHub Actions

This repository demonstrates a basic CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline using GitHub, Docker Hub, and GitHub Actions. It automates the process of building, testing, and deploying a simple application whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

## Overview

The CI/CD pipeline works as follows:

1.  **Code Changes:** A developer pushes code changes to the `main` branch of this GitHub repository.
2.  **GitHub Actions Trigger:** The push event triggers a GitHub Actions workflow defined in `.github/workflows/main.yml`.
3.  **Build and Test:** The GitHub Actions workflow builds the application, runs any defined tests, and performs static analysis.
4.  **Docker Image Build:** If the build and tests are successful, the workflow builds a Docker image of the application.
5.  **Docker Image Push:** The workflow tags the Docker image with a version number (based on the Git commit SHA) and pushes it to a Docker Hub repository.
6.  **Deployment (Optional):** The workflow can optionally trigger a deployment process to a staging or production environment.  This might involve updating a Kubernetes deployment, deploying to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP), or running other deployment scripts.

## Prerequisites

*   **GitHub Account:** You need a GitHub account to host the repository and run GitHub Actions.
*   **Docker Hub Account:** You need a Docker Hub account to store the Docker images.
*   **Docker Installed:** Docker needs to be installed locally if you want to build and test the image locally.
*   **GitHub Actions Secrets:** You need to configure the following secrets in your GitHub repository settings (Settings -> Secrets -> Actions):
    *   `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username.
    *   `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`:  A Docker Hub access token with write permissions to your repository.  It is strongly recommended to use a token instead of your password.

## Configuration

1.  **GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/main.yml`):**  This file defines the CI/CD pipeline.  You'll need to customize it to match your application's build, test, and deployment requirements.  Pay close attention to the Docker Hub repository name and image tags.
2.  **Dockerfile:**  The `Dockerfile` defines how to build the Docker image for your application.  Ensure that it correctly installs dependencies, copies application code, and sets the appropriate entry point.
3.  **Application Code (`app/`):**  This directory contains the source code for your application.
4.  **Tests (`tests/`):**  This directory contains the tests for your application.  Good test coverage is crucial for a reliable CI/CD pipeline.

## Example `.github/workflows/main.yml`

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Python 3.9
        uses: actions/setup-python@v3
        with:
          python-version: 3.9

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest tests/

      - name: Build Docker image
        run: docker build -t ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}/my-app:${GITHUB_SHA::8} .

      - name: Log in to Docker Hub
        run: docker login -u ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }} -p ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Push Docker image
        run: docker push ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}/my-app:${GITHUB_SHA::8}
